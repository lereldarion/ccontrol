Benchmarks
==========

This directory contains code snippets to demonstrate how ccontrol can be used
to measure and optimize cache performance.

Note: stencil.c and cache\_latency.c have not been adapted to the new ccontrol.
cache-bandwidth.c is a small (badly designed) cache bandwidth experiment that
is up to date with ccontrol itself.

The exp.h file
==============

This file contains macros do use [PAPI](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/) or the
`librt` to measure the performance of small code regions. See the `stencil`
benchmark for example use.

Multigrid Stencil
=================

This code is explained in details in the
[paper](http://moais.imag.fr/membres/swann.perarnau/pdfs/cacheics11.pdf).  The
basic idea behind this is to build an application comprised of 4 data
structures having different cache requirements.

Algorithm
---------

The algorithm implemented is the following : three inputs matrices are
allocated and filled with random data. Each cell of these matrices is a cache
line wide. This cell contains only a double value and padding data.

The matrix `M3` is the biggest one, its size is specified as `H` rows and
`L3_SIZE` columns. `M2` is a fourth of `M3` : `H/2` and `L3_SIZE/2`. `M1` is a
fourth of `M2`. A fourth matrix `R` is the same size as `M3`.

The only code region that matters and is analysed in the paper is similar to a
stencil algorithm : a _cross_ of 9 cells are summed in each of the M matrices
and the result is written to R. By _cross_ we mean something like that :

        ---------------------
       	|   |   | x |   |   |
       	---------------------
       	|   |   | x |   |   |
       	---------------------
       	| x | x | x | x | x |
       	---------------------
       	|   |   | x |   |   |
       	---------------------
       	|   |   | x |   |   |
       	---------------------

The cache requirement of each matrix is easy to visualise : if 5 lines fit in
cache, the program achieves maximum reuse. But since the result of a cell is
computed at once, in a standard setting the cache must save 3x5 lines
simultaneously. Note that there is no advantage to caching `R`, as it is only
written a line at a time.

Cache Optimization
------------------

Using CControl however it is possible to isolate each input matrix inside a
distinct cache partition, so that they all achieve maximum performance and do
not thrash each other.

In this application, we understand perfectly our cache requirement and could
thus just deduce the size (in colors) of each partition and be done with it.
The following only demonstrate what should be done if the requirement of a data
structure is less obvious.

Say we want to determine how much cache `M3` requires. One solution is to measure
the cache misses triggered by the application, starting with little cache for
`M3`, and increasing progressively the cache given to it.  As we increase the
cache given to the matrix,it will progressively fit better in cache until achieving
maximum performance. To provide a baseline against which a cache misses
variation can be seen, we isolate all the other data structure of fixed size (small) so that
the cache misses triggered by the rest of the application stay stable.
We will obtain something like that :


        Cache Misses
        ^
        |
        |
        |---------
        |         \
        |          \
        |           \
        |            --------------
        -----------------------------> Colors given to M3 partition

                    ^
                 This is the optimal partition size for M3


Cache Latency
=============

Ulrich Drepper documented with lot of details in _What Every Programmer Should
Know About Memory_ a simple code to measure the cache latency of a system : the
average time it takes to access a given cache level.

The idea of this code is to access a lot of time the same memory region, but in
a random way. By ensuring each access touches a different cache line, this
randomness bypass any prefetch mechanism in the system.

The size of the memory region touched determines if all access will eventually
fall in a given cache level or not. By playing with this size, an experimenter
can measure the average access time of each cache level in his system.

The code present in this repository has two versions : a _linux_ one that
replicate the traditional experiment and a _ccontrol_ version that allows
someone to verify if ccontrol correctly partition the cache.

In the _linux_ version, there is only one parameter : the size, as a power of
2, of the memory region manipulated. In the _ccontrol_ version, a second
parameter exists : the number of colors to limit the memory region into. This
allows someone to compare at which region size the last cache is filled and RAM
is systematically touched. This code is, by design, a mean to verify the
correctness of ccontrol on a system (even if the check is difficult to
automate).
